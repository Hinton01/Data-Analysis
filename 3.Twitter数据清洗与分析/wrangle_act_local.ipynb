    "## 简介\n",
    "\n",
    "我们将要整理 (以及分析和可视化) 的数据集是推特用户 @dog_rates 的档案, 推特昵称为 WeRateDogs。他以诙谐幽默的方式对人们的宠物狗评分。这些评分通常以 10 作为分母。但是分子则一般大于 10：11/10、12/10、13/10 等等。\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs下载了他们的推特档案，并通过电子邮件发送给优达学城，专门为本项目使用。这个档案是基本的推特数据（推特 ID、时间戳、推特文本等），包含了截止到 2017 年 4 月 1 日的 5000 多条推特。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 目标\n",
    "清洗 WeRateDogs 推特数据，创建有趣且可靠的分析和可视化。<br/>\n",
    "（但是这份推特档案只包含基本的推特信息。所以还需要收集额外的数据。）<br/>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "我们在这个项目中的任务如下：<br/>\n",
    "数据整理，其中包括：<br/>\n",
    "收集数据，评估数据，清洗数据。<br/>\n",
    "对清洗过的数据进行储存、分析和可视化。<br/>\n",
    "书面报告 (1) 数据整理工作 (2) 数据分析和可视化<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 步骤与细节\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.数据收集\n",
    "收集下面所述的三份数据：<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. WeRateDogs 的推特档案。这个数据文件是直接提供的，详见twitter_archive_enhanced.csv。\n",
    "2. 推特图像的预测数据，这个文件你需要使用 Python 的 Requests 库和以下提供的 URL 来进行编程下载。\n",
    "3. 每条推特的额外附加数据，要包含转发数（retweet_count）和喜欢数（favorite_count）这两列。推荐使用Twitter API。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.数据评估\n",
    "收集上述三个数据集之后，使用目测评估和编程评估的方式，对数据进行质量和清洁度的评估。<br/>\n",
    "完整地评估和清理整个数据集将需要大量时间，出于学习和实践的考虑，本项目只是评估和清理此数据集中的8个质量问题和2个整洁度问题。<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.数据清洗\n",
    "对你在评估时列出的每个问题进行清洗。展示清洗的过程,结果应该为一个优质干净整洁的主数据集（pandas DataFrame 类型）<br/>\n",
    "根据整洁数据的规则要求，本项目的数据清理应该包括将三个数据片段进行合并。<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.对项目数据进行存储、分析和可视化\n",
    "将清理后的数据集存储到 CSV 文件中，命名为 twitter_archive_master.csv。如果有其他观察对象的数据集存在，需要多个表格，那么要给这些文件合理命名。<br/>\n",
    "对清洗后的数据进行分析和可视化。生成至少 3 个见解和 1 个可视化。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.项目汇报\n",
    "创建一个 300-600 字的书面报告，命名为 wrangle_report.pdf，在该报告中简要描述你的数据整理过程。这份报告可以看作是一份内部文档，供你的团队成员查看交流。<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "创建一个 250 字以上的书面报告，命名为 act_report.pdf，在该报告中，你可以与读者交流观点，展示你使用整理过的数据生成的可视化图表。这份报告可以看作是一份外部文档，如博客帖子或杂志文章。<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 细节：\n",
    "\n",
    "我们只需要含有图片的原始评级 (不包括转发)。尽管数据集中有 5000 多条数据，但是并不是所有都是狗狗评分，并且其中有一些是转发。<br/>\n",
    "如果分子评级超过分母评级，不需要进行清洗。这个 特殊评分系统 是 WeRateDogs 人气度较高的主要原因。（同样，也不需要删除分子小于分母的数据）<br/>\n",
    "不必收集 2017 年 8 月 1 日之后的数据，你可以收集到这些推特的基本信息，但是你不能收集到这些推特对应的图像预测数据，因为你没有图像预测算法的使用权限。<br/>\n",
    "不要在项目提交中包含你的推特 API 密钥和访问令牌（可以用 * 号代替）。\n",
